Evaluating Attention-Based Models for Violence Classification in Videos
------------------------------------------------------------
**Marcos Teixeira**, Jan 2020

This repository contains source code for my Master's thesis, which describes a study about Attention Mechanisms in the context of Violence Classification in videos. We conducted all experiments at the [RECOD laboratory](https://recodbr.wordpress.com). The computer is equipped with a Ubuntu 16.04 operating system machine, Intel Core i7-3770K 3.50 GHz, and 128~GB of memory. For graphic-intense applications, the computer is also equipped with two NVIDIA Titan XP GPU with 12 GB of GPU memory and 3,840 CUDA cores. 

For details about the method see [PDF with the Master's thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SfwYSlannkKXnHxuOlJodt2baYoow6-g/view?usp=sharing).
